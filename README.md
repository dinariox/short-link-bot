# Link Shortening Bot for Discord

This is a bot for Discord servers. It scans messages sent by users in all channels it has access to. If it detects a "amazon.de" or "amazon.com" url, it will delete the message and send a shortened version of that link. The bit.ly API is used for shortening the urls.

## Future

In the future, general link shortening may be implemented.
